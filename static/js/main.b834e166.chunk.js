The less liquid, the crispier the tofu will be. To do this, place a stack of paper towels on a plate. Wrap the tofu block in more paper towels, then place a second plate on top. Add several heavy items on top to weight the tofu down (canned food is perfect). Let sit 5 to 10 minutes while you prep the rest of the recipe. Cut the tofu into 3/4-inch cubes.","In a large nonstick skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot but not smoking, add the tofu and drizzle with 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Saute, stirring every minute or so until the tofu is nicely colored on all sides and the moisture has cooked off, about 8 to 10 minutes.","In a separate pan roast your vegetables and lightly season it with black pepper and salt. Once the vegetables are finished roasting, add several large handfuls of spinach, stirring as you go so that it wilts and you can fit more in the pan. Once the first addition has wilted, continue to add and wilt the spinach by handfuls, until all of the spinach is added. It will seem like a ridiculous amount at first but will cook down considerably. Add the veggies to your skillet of tofu.","In a separate bowl add sriracha, corn starch, soy sauce, and white vinegar. Add the mixture to your veggies and tofu.","Heat should be at low at this point, mix the sauce, veggies and tofu evenly for 1 minute. Remove from the heat. Serve hot, with brown rice, noodles, or whatever you like, along with a few dashes of additional soy sauce and chili paste or flakes to taste."]},{"id":4,"title":"Baked Sweet Potatoes (Oven)","ingredients":["1 Sweet Potato","Onion Powder","Garlic Powder","Salt","Black Pepper","Cayenne Chilli Powder","Olive Oil (Preferred)"],"instructions":["Cut sweet potato into small even slices (like half-sized french fries)","Spread slices across a baking tray","Drizzle lightly with olive oil","Sprinkle onion powder, garlic powder, salt, black pepper and cayenne chilli powder to your discretion","Bake at 420 fahrenheit for 20-30 minutes (or until outside of slices is crispy)"]}]')},,function(e,t,o){e.exports=o(12)},,,,,function(e,t,o){},function(e,t,o){},function(e,t,o){"use strict";o.r(t);var n=o(0),i=o.n(n),a=o(2),r=o.n(a),s=(o(10),o(4));o(11);function l(e){var t=e.title,o=e.ingredients,a=e.instructions,r=Object(n.useState)(!1),l=Object(s.a)(r,2),c=l[0],u=l[1];return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"recipe"},i.a.createElement("div",{onClick:function(){u(!1===c)},className:"recipe-title"},t),c&&i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement("div",{className:"recipe-ingredients-title"},"Ingredients"),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"recipe-ingredients"},i.a.createElement("ul",null,o.map((function(e,t){return i.a.createElement("li",{className:"recipe-ingredients-item",key:t},e)})))),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"recipe-instructions-title"},"Instructions"),i.a.createElement("div",{className:"recipe-instructions"},i.a.createElement("ol",null,a.map((function(e,t){return i.a.createElement("li",{className:"recipe-instructions-item",key:t},e)}))))))}var c=function(e){var t=e.recipes;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,t.map((function(e){return i.a.createElement(l,{key:e.id,title:e.title,ingredients:e.ingredients,instructions:e.instructions})})))},u=o(3);var d=function(e){var t=e.title;return i.a.createElement("div",{className:"header-title"}," ",t," ")};var h=function(){return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement(d,{title:"My Recipes"}),i.a.createElement(c,{recipes:u}))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(i.a.createElement(i.a.StrictMode,null,i.a.createElement(h,null)),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then((function(e){e.unregister()})).catch((function(e){console.error(e.message)}))}],[[5,1,2]]]);
